# timewarp

Run a command with a faked system time — without `LD_PRELOAD`.

```
timewarp '2023-01-01 00:00:00' date
timewarp '@0'                   date
timewarp '+30d'                 curl ...
timewarp '-1h38m24s'            ./my-binary

# with runtime control:
timewarp '-1y' --control /tmp/tw.sock bash
timewarp-ctl /tmp/tw.sock '+30d'
timewarp-ctl /tmp/tw.sock '2024-06-01 12:00:00'
```

## Motivation

The standard tool for time-faking under Linux is
[libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime).  It works by
preloading a shared library (`libfaketime.so`) that overrides libc's
`clock_gettime`, `gettimeofday` and `time` wrappers before the program
starts.

This approach has two fundamental limitations:

**1. It requires a matching ELF interpreter.**
`LD_PRELOAD` is processed by the dynamic linker (`ld-linux.so`).  When
a binary ships with a non-standard interpreter path — for example the
relocated `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` baked in by `patchelf` in a self-contained
tool archive — the system linker is never invoked and `LD_PRELOAD` is silently
ignored.  This is exactly the situation in the `bench-tools` archive that
`timewarp` was built for.

**2. It does not work with statically linked binaries.**
A static binary carries its own libc; there is no dynamic linker to process
`LD_PRELOAD`, so the preloaded library is never loaded.

`timewarp` has neither limitation.  It works at the syscall level, below the
C runtime, and requires no cooperation from the target binary's linker setup.

## How it works

`timewarp` combines two Linux kernel mechanisms:

### 1. Disabling the vDSO (via ptrace)

On x86-64, `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)` and `gettimeofday()` are normally
served by the **vDSO** — a small read-only page mapped into every process by
the kernel.  The vDSO reads time data directly from a shared memory region
without issuing a real syscall.  This makes time queries fast, but it also
means they are invisible to `seccomp` filters and `ptrace` syscall
interception.

The C runtime (glibc, musl) discovers the vDSO at startup by reading
`AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` from the ELF auxiliary vector (`auxv`) on the stack.  If
this entry is zero the runtime falls back to regular syscalls for all time
functions.

`timewarp` uses `ptrace` to zero `AT_SYSINFO_EHDR` in the child's `auxv` at
the **exec-stop** — the instant after `execve` succeeds but before the new
program has executed a single instruction.  The C runtime then initialises
without the vDSO, and every subsequent time call becomes a real syscall.

### 2. Intercepting time syscalls (via seccomp user notification)

`SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF` (Linux ≥ 5.0) allows a supervisor process to
intercept specific syscalls made by a child and respond to them from user
space, without `ptrace` overhead.

Before calling `execvp`, the child installs a BPF filter that redirects
`clock_gettime`, `gettimeofday` and `time` to a notification queue.  The
resulting file descriptor is handed to the parent via a Unix socket
(`SCM_RIGHTS`) before `exec` replaces the child's address space.  The
filter is **inherited across `fork()` and `exec()`**, so all descendants
are automatically covered.

In the supervisor loop the parent:

1. Waits for a notification with `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV`.
2. Reads the real time, adds the configured offset.
3. Writes the faked `struct timespec` / `struct timeval` / `time_t`
   directly into the child's memory with `process_vm_writev`.
4. Unblocks the child thread with `SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_SEND`.

The child thread is blocked for the entire duration and receives the faked
value as the return of its own syscall — transparent to the application.

### 3. Process-tree tracking (via PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK)

The vDSO disabling step must be repeated at **every** `execve()` in the
process tree, because the kernel writes a fresh `auxv` (including a new
`AT_SYSINFO_EHDR`) for each `execve()`.  Without tree tracking,
grandchildren spawned by a shell (`bash -c date`) would get the vDSO
re-enabled and bypass the seccomp filter.

`timewarp` solves this by **staying attached to the whole process tree**
after the initial exec-stop:

- `PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK` / `PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK` — auto-attach to every
  forked child and deliver a `PTRACE_EVENT_FORK` stop.
- `PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC` — deliver an exec-stop for every `execve()` in
  every traced process, so `disable_vdso()` is called again.
- `PTRACE_O_EXITKILL` — kill all tracees if the supervisor exits
  abnormally, preventing orphaned processes.

The supervisor loop polls both `notif_fd` (seccomp) and a `signalfd`
(SIGCHLD) simultaneously, handling both time-call interception and ptrace
tree events in a single thread.

## Comparison with libfaketime

| | libfaketime | timewarp |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanism | `LD_PRELOAD` | seccomp + ptrace |
| Standard interpreter required | **yes** | no |
| Works with static binaries | **no** | yes |
| Works with custom `patchelf` interpreter | **no** | yes |
| vDSO clock calls intercepted | yes (libc level) | yes (vDSO disabled) |
| Works with shell grandchildren (e.g. `bash -c date`) | yes | yes |
| Requires Linux ≥ 5.0 | no | **yes** |
| No extra privileges needed | yes | yes (same-UID parent) |
| Speed factor / clock drift simulation | yes | no |
| Shared memory file (`-f FILE`) | yes | no |

## Time format

```
timewarp TIME command [args...]
```

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` | `'2023-06-01 12:00:00'` | Absolute local time |
| `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM` | `'2023-06-01 12:00'` | Absolute, seconds = 0 |
| `YYYY-mm-dd` | `'2023-06-01'` | Absolute, midnight |
| `@EPOCH` | `'@0'` | Unix timestamp |
| `+NyNdNhNmNs` | `'+1y6h'` | Relative offset forward |
| `-NyNdNhNmNs` | `'-1h38m24s'` | Relative offset backward |

Relative offsets can be compound: `+1y6h` means +365 days and +6 hours.
Units: `y` = 365 days, `d` = day, `h` = hour, `m` = minute, `s` = second.
A bare integer defaults to seconds: `+3600` = `+1h`.

## Runtime control

Start timewarp with `--control PATH` to expose a Unix socket:

```sh
timewarp '-1y' --control /tmp/tw.sock bash
```

From another terminal, send a new time with `timewarp-ctl`:

```sh
timewarp-ctl /tmp/tw.sock '+30d'          # shift forward 30 days from now
timewarp-ctl /tmp/tw.sock '2024-06-01'   # jump to an absolute date
```

The supervisor updates its offset immediately; the next intercepted time
call returns the new value.  The socket file is removed when timewarp exits
normally.

## Building

```sh
make
```

Produces two binaries: `timewarp` and `timewarp-ctl`.

Requires: gcc, Linux kernel headers ≥ 5.0, glibc.

## Limitations

- **x86-64 only** — the vDSO disabling code reads `rsp` from
  `struct user_regs_struct`, which is architecture-specific.  Other
  architectures would need their own register access and may or may not have
  a vDSO for time calls.
- **Linux ≥ 5.0** — `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF` was introduced in Linux 5.0.
- **Single-threaded supervisor** — the notification loop handles one
  intercepted call at a time.  A child that issues many concurrent time calls
  from multiple threads will see each call serialised through the supervisor.
  In practice this is not measurable for typical bench-tool workloads.
- **clone()-spawned processes** — processes created via `clone()` without
  `SIGCHLD` as the exit signal (i.e. threads) are not auto-attached.
  Threads share the parent's address space so the vDSO is already disabled
  for them; this limitation only affects exotic process-creation patterns
  that do not use `fork()` or `vfork()`.
- **No clock drift / speed factor** — the offset is constant; the clock
  advances at real speed.  libfaketime's `-f` and speed-factor features are
  not implemented.
- **`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`** — installing the seccomp filter requires setting
  this flag on the child, which prevents it from gaining privileges via
  setuid or file capabilities.
